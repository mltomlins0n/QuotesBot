# QuotesBot

A simple Discord bot to provide encouragement, quotes, and jokes from a couple of APIs.

## Commands

`!inspire` - Get a random inspiring quote. 

`!joke` - Get a random joke. **(Random jokes aren't filtered, so it could be racist, sexist etc. You have been warned).**

`!safe` - Get a safe joke.

`!pun` - Get a pun. It's probably stupid.

`!nerd` - Get a programming || coding joke. You nerd.

`!fact` - Get a random (possibly useless) fact.

`!today` - Get the fact of the day.

`!list` - List the current custom encouraging messages.
Use this command before using `!del`, so you know which 
message you're about to delete.

Type `!new` followed by your message to add a new
custom encouraging message, be nice!

Type `!del` and a no. from 0 to the current no. of custom messages to delete that message ise it turns out to be wildly inappropriate. 
E.g. `!del 0` deletes the first message in the list.

`!responding` - use `!responding off` to stop the bot from 
responding to trigger words. use `!responding on` to turn it back on. Responding is on 
by default.
